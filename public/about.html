<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Designer and Budding Web Developer</h2>

<p>
I enjoy putting my design skills to good use by impacting our society at large.
In my leisure time, I organize fundraisers for community cats through my artwork.
At church, I am a designer and producer.

<p>
I aspire to expand my arsenal of skills by picking up web development.
In time to come, I hope that I can shape the digital landscape of Singapore.
